A tribute to the (no longer existing) flash-game 'Inverted'.
Your goal in this awesome new spin on Tetris is to practice your multi-tasking abilities.
You must avoid letting the blocks hit the top or the bottom for as long as possible.
Use the ARROW KEYS to control top half of the game and use WASD KEYS to control bottom half of the game.
Good luck!
